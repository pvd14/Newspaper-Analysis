Mugger who tried to rob Arsenal stars Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac jailed for 10 years


An armed mugger has been jailed for 10 years after attempting to rob two Arsenal footballers of luxury watches worth £200,000.

Harrow Crown Court heard that Ashley Smith, 30, and his accomplice Jordan Northover, 26, targeted Bosnian defender Sead Kolasinac and his German teammate Mesut Ozil.

Smith, of Archway, north London, had previously pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery just feet from Kolasinac's home in Hampstead, north west London, on July 25.

He appeared in court on Friday by video-link and masked his face with a blue scarf.

His mother sobbed in the public gallery as he was sentenced to a decade behind bars. Northover will be sentenced at a later date.

CCTC footage showed Bosnian international Kolasinac fighting off Northover as he prodded him with a needle.

"They recognised an opportunity to rob both victims and Mr Ozil who was in the vehicle with his newly wed wife and they moved in armed and dangerous.

"They positioned the moped closely next to the vehicle and between them produced these weapons which they threatened Mr Kolasinac with and it's clear were thrust in the victim's direction and made contact with him.

"It is clear the two of them hadn't counted on Mr Kolasinac fighting back and he behaved incredibly bravely with knives pointed in his direction at a time when he knew he was in possession of extremely valuable items which men might use whatever they needed to obtain the watches.
