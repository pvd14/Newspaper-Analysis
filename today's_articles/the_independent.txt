General election: Labour candidate facing calls to quit over abusive posts about Tories


A Labour parliamentary candidate is facing calls to resign after it emerged that he shared a social media post calling a female Tory peer a “c***”.

Ian Byrne, the party’s candidate in the safe Labour seat of Liverpool West Derby, shared a Facebook post about Baroness Michelle Mone, the founder of the Ultimo underwear brand, calling on people to “hit this c*** where it hurts”.

He also described Tory minister Esther McVey as a “bastard”, adding that she was “soon to be gone”. 

Tory cabinet minister Liz Truss said the posts were ”disgusting and sexist” and called for the candidate to stand down “immediately”.

In 2015, Mr Byrne shared a post that called on people to boycott Ultimo after Ms Mone was made a Conservative peer.

It read: “This is Michelle Mone. She grew up in the working class end of Glasgow. She set up the Ultimo bra brand. She was sworn into the House of Lords and the first thing she did was vote to take tax credits away from people from a similar background to her. Please remember that this Christmas when you are buying presents.”

The post, uncovered by LBC, was captioned: “Hit this c*** where it hurts.”

A year earlier, Mr Byrne shared a post suggesting that Ms McVey, then the employment minister, was on course to lose her seat at the 2015 election, which she subsequently did.

Another user commented on the post saying: “She is a horrible bastard.” Mr Byrne agreed, replying: “Bastard...and soon to be gone.”

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has also faced criticism over his past comments about Mr McVey.

In 2014, he asked Labour activists campaigning to oust the MP: “Why are we sacking her? Why aren’t we lynching the bastard?”.
