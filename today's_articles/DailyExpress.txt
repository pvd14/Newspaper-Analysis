Corbyn's WAR ON CARS! Huge tax hikes coming your way as Labour plots to cut drivers by 60%


LABOUR leader Jeremy Corbyn will start a war on cars if he wins the next
month's general election with radical plans which could see 60 percent of
vehicles cut from the nation’s road in a decade.
The radical changes come as Labour pledges to axe road deaths and serious
injuries on UK roads to zero in a dramatic claim. Labour’s manifesto has
pledged the UK will become less reliant on cars under the party's reign
with radical proposals set to shake up the industry.
Labour has promised to axe tradition combustion vehicles in just over a
decade as well as issue massive tax boosts to motorists all over the
country.

According to the party, sales of new cars with combustion engines will 
be banned by 2030 with a promise to invest in electric infrastructure.
Their manifesto comes just days after an internal Labour Party report
highlighted shocking plans to dramatically hike prices on all road users.
Plans to increase fuel duty would see the price of petrol and diesel
increase by a massive 13p per litre over five years.

The Conservative Party has frozen fuel duty increases for the past nine
years and the party’s manifesto is set to pledge an extension on this
popular policy.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps attacked Labour’s plans for the nation’s
roads, claiming Corbyn was coming for then nations cars.
He added: “It is now clear that Labour have secret plans to clobber
hardworking people with a barrage of tax hikes on their family car,
that would leave families with less money in their pockets.
“Labour’s extreme economic policies would be a disaster for drivers."
